# Eric's Programming examples

These are things I've written as solutions to programming tests.

## FizzBuzz.java

My solution to Hackerrank's FizzBuzz challenge.

It's Java golf to solve FizzBuzz with the least number of characters.
Note:  The filename and class name do not match because I wanted
the file to have a descriptive name.

This was my attempt without looking up any fancy Java techniques.
